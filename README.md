## Executive Summary:
The Lunar Madness team investigated correlations between full moon and crime statistics in four diverse US cities. The main objective is to help inform local government, law enforcement, hospitals, and first responders of established patterns to help them plan their staffing needs and preparedness based on our findings.

## Lunar Lunacy Effect Defined
The idea that the full moon influences human behavior, sometimes called the "lunar lunacy effect" or "Transylvania effect," has been around for centuries. The term "lunatic" even originates from the Latin word *luna*, meaning "moon." Throughout history, folklore and myths from around the world have associated the full moon to erratic behavior, ranging from medieval legends of werewolves and vampires to more modern theories suggesting that the moon's gravitational pull might affect the brain's fluids and, in turn, behavior. 

## Hypothesis
The Lunar Madness team sought to test the validity of the lunar lunacy effect by comparing crime and traffic data against full moon dates in 4 major metropolitan cities: Austin, Denver, Houston and Los Angeles. If our hypothesis is true, we should see a higher volume of erratic behavior on days with a full moon. 

Erratic behavior is defined as "unpredictable, irregular, or inconsistent behavior that deviates from what is considered normal. It wan include mood swings, impulsive actions, and exaggerated emotional responses. 


## Identify Correlation:
If the disparate city crime data can be categorized with specific crime types, we will investigate and look for patterns that indicate if peopleâ€™s criminal behavior are influenced by the lunar cycle. Explore potential explanations for any observed correlations (e.g., increased visibility during full moon).

1. Identify if there is a strong correlation between full moon and traffic accidents
2. Identify if there is a strong correlation between full moon and crime
3. If these effects exist, drill down and identify more granular relationships in the data
4. Explore other relationships that may be uncovered during the initial exploratory analysis


## Statistical Significance:
- Determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between moon phases and crime rates in sampled metropolitan areas (Chicago, Austin, Denver & Los Angels) between the years of _____ & 2024.

- Identify any specific crime types that may be more strongly influenced by the lunar cycle. Explore potential explanations for any observed correlations (e.g., increased visibility during full moon).

## Staffing Needs:
If proven that there is high correlation between crime related offenses with the phases of the moon, this information could then be useful for properly staffing respective public departments (law enforcement, tow trucks, emergency services, Fire Stations, Hospitals, and 911 call centers) to support a higher volume of erratic behavior.
